# Z-NIX
An experimental OS I'm building to further understand Assembly and how an OS works at the lowest level.

# About
Z-NIX is an experimental operating system I am building. 
Z-NIX is UNIX-like and is built in C, C++ and Assembly.

I'm not an expert at building an OS, so the code may be a bit messy at times.
